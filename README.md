## NLP_News_Summarizer

The aim of this project is to fine-tune a Pegasus transformer model for the task of
abstractive summarization of news articles. The primary objective is to create a tool that
simplifies news consumption by generating concise and coherent summaries, allowing
users to quickly grasp the core insights from news articles. This project seeks to
streamline the information retrieval process, enhance comprehension, and empower
individuals to make well-informed decisions in an information-rich environment.

### Deployment
The model has been deployed on streamlit. Three options are available for users to input
data for generating summaries.The interface provides flexibility by allowing users to enter
text, upload an MP3 file, or input a YouTube video link. Each option serves a unique
purpose, enabling users to generate concise summaries based on their preferred input
method.
